<h1>audio_start_recording</h1>

<h2>Start recording audio to the recorder buffer from a given source.</h2>

<h3>Syntax:</h3>
<p class="code">audio_start_recording(recorder_index);</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>recorder_index</td>
	<td>The index of the recorder source to use.</td></tr>
	
</table>
</div>
<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns: </b>Index
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This function will start recording audio from the recorder source indexed. You can get the number of recorder sources using the function <a href="audio_get_recorder_count.html">
<tt>audio_get_recorder_count()</tt></a>, and once you start recording the audio will be stored in a temporary buffer and start triggering an 
<a href="../../../001_Advanced%20Use/More%20About%20Async%20Events/Audio%20Recording.html">Audio Recording Asynchronous Event</a>. This event is triggered every step that recording takes place and will create the 
special <tt>ds_map</tt> in the variable <tt>async_load</tt> with the following key/value pairs:

<ul>
	<li> "buffer_id" - the ID of the temporary buffer you can use to retrieve the audio data
	<li> "channel_index" - the recording channel index (as returned by the function) this data came from
	<li> "data_len" - the length of data (in bytes) you've received
</ul>

<p>
Note that after the asynchronous event has been triggered, the audio in the temporary buffer will be wiped, so you should be copying it's data into a custom buffer that you have previously created.
<blockquote>
	<i><b>NOTE: </b>Recording audio is currently only available currently for the <b>Windows</b>, <b>Xbox One</b>, <b>PlayStation 4</b> and <b>HTML5</b> target modules.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p class="code">
audio_record = audio_start_recording(0);
</p>
<p>
The above code starts recording from the recorder source 0, storing the channel index of the recording in the variable "audio_record" for use in the asynchronous Audio Recording event.
