The <b>GameMaker: Player</b> is a stand alone application that can be used to play games made with GameMaker: Studio. It comes bundled with GameMaker, and as a developer you can upload your games to 
it as well as play other people's games. If you have created a developer account, you can log in to the Player app from GameMaker: Studio using the option in this window. You can find further information about 
becoming a developer and uploading games from the YoYo Games Knowledge Base here - <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/forums/23059503" target="_blank">
Player Articles</a>.

The menu shown above is the menu after you have logged in to your Player account. If you do not have an account yet, then simply click the <b>Log In</b> option and click the link "<i>Create a new account...</i>" 
to create your account and get access to the Player and the games it contains.
