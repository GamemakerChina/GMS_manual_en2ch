Marketplace is where you can buy and sell assets. These can be frameworks, engines, sprites, scripts, shaders, or anything else related to making games with <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>. You can find a list of 
dedicated tutorials that cover exactly how to create, upload and sell your assets from the YoYo Games Knowledge Base here - <a href="http://help.yoyogames.com/forums/23024928-FAQ" target="_blank">
Marketplace</a>.
<br>
<br>

The menu shown above is the menu after you have logged in to your Marketplace account. If you do not have an account yet, then simply click the <b>Log In</b> option and click the link "<i>Create a new account...</i>" 
to create your account and get access to the market and the assets it contains.

Once you have created your account, you can then log in through this menu, supplying your log in details as shown in the image above. When you have logged in, clicking any of the first three menu options will open 
the Marketplace window on one of the three available tabs: <b>Marketplace</b>, <b>My Library</b>, or <b>Package Manager</b>. You can find more information on these from the section on the 
<a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/Marketplace.html">Marketplace</a>.
