<h1>The Advertising Tab</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the Advertising tab of the Global Game
Settings window.</h2>

<blockquote><span style="font-size:18px"><i><b>WARNING!</b> As of
the 1.3 update to GameMaker: Studio, this tab is no longer
applicable to the Android and iOS target platforms. Instead, please
see the section on <a href=
"../../001_Advanced%20Use/Extensions/index.html">Extensions</a> as
advertising on these platforms is now supported through Extension
Packages.</i></span>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="Advertising_Tab.png"> This tab can be
used to set up and control the add providers you use for your
games, as well as how their adverts are displayed within your game.
There are three <i>sub-tabs</i> provided for each of the target
platforms that permit advertising (Android, iOS, HTML5 and Windows
Phone), but they all have the same layout as that pictured in the
above window example.<br>
<br></p>

<h3>Enabling Ads</h3>

<p>To switch advertising on for your game, you must first check the
box labelled "<b>Enable Advertising</b>" and then select the
advertiser that you wish to use as the provider from the drop down
menu shown: <img class="center" src="Advertisers.png"></p>

<h3>Testing Ads</h3>

<p>If you wish to test out your adverts in a test game or to see
how they look, you can also check the box labelled "<b>Use Test Ads
(where available)</b>", and, depending on the provider, you should
be able to compile and run your game with advertising coming though
as you would see it in a "live" game, but without it actually
counting towards your ad revenue. For more information on this
feature and to see which companies support it, please see the
section <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Advertising%20and%20Analytics/index.html">Reference
- Advertising and Analytics</a>.<br>
<br></p>

<h3>Ad Providers</h3>

<p>Each target has a different set of advertising providers (the
image above is just an example) and the list will change as more
become available. Once you have chosen your provider, you should
then choose which advert type you wish to display in your game.
this is done by supplying the <b>Key</b> that the provider has
given you for the advert type and by selecting the <b>shape</b> of
the advert as it should be shown within your game. These shapes
will vary from provider to provider, so you you should check with
them for the exact size and layout of each ad.<br>
<br>
You should note that there is one final add-type that may be
available for your provider, and that is <i>interstitial ads</i>.
These normally take the form of full page adverts which can be
offer walls (essentially a page to promote several different
advertising campaigns), virtual currency deals, or a video and
there are a number of specific functions that can be used to launch
those ads should the provider permit them.<br>
<br>
When you have finished specifying your provider and the ads you
wish to support, you will then need to set them up from within your
game code using the functions found in the section: <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Advertising%20and%20Analytics/index.html">Reference
- Advertising and Analytics</a>.<br>
<br>
For information on individual Ad providers, please see the <a href=
"http://help.yoyogames.com/forums/22239281-Ads-and-Analytics"
target="_blank">YoYo Knowledge Base</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> This functionality is limited to the <a href=
"../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">Professional
Version</a> of</i> GameMaker: Studio.<br>
