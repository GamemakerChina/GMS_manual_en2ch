<h1>Global Variables</h1>

<h2>This section explains what global variables are and how to use
them.</h2>

<p>A basic description of a global variable is one that, once
declared, belongs to no instance in particular and yet can be
accessed by all. Just like local variables, global variables must
be declared, but unlike a local variable, a global variable remains
in memory until the end of the game. So, you can create a global
variable to keep track of (for example) the number of bullets that
the player has and then just update this variable at different
points in the game. A global variable does not belong to any
specific instance and can be accessed, changed and used by all
instances at any time, but any change made to the variable are
"global", in that all instances using the variable will be affected
by the change. Let's have a look at an example:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">globalvar food;<br>
food = 5;<br></p>

<p><br>
So, we have created a new variable called "food" and we have
declared it as global. Now, any instance can use and change this
variable in any way and all other instances will "see" this. For
example we could have a food object that the player collides with
and in the collision event we have:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">food +=1;<br></p>

<p><br>
We also have another object that draws this value like this:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">draw_text(32, 32, "food = " +
string(food));<br></p>

<p><br>
With global variables we can change values and see those changes
reflected in all instances of the objects that reference this
variable. As with local variables you have to take care not to name
your global variables the same as any instance variables as that
will cause you problems and make bugs creep into your games! We can
actually call global variables in another way to help with this
problem, and that is by using the word "global" and a "." before
the variable. The following example illustrates this and is exactly
the same as the one given above:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">global.food = 5;<br></p>

<p><br>
With this method, we will now have to use "global" every time we
wish to use the variable like so:<br>
<br></p>

<p class="code">global.food += 1;<br></p>

<p class="code">draw_text(32, 32, "food = " +
string(global.food));<br></p>

<p><br>
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> has a collection of "built in" global
variables too, so you should be aware of them as you may name one
of your instance variables the same or wish to have your own global
variable with the same name and wonder why you are getting errors!
They are easy to spot, however, as they are shown in a different
colour in the code editor and also come up in the auto-complete bar
at the bottom. the majority of built in global variables are very
specific and will only be used on rare occasions, but there are
three in particular which are very useful and you can find out more
about them from the pages listed below:<br>
