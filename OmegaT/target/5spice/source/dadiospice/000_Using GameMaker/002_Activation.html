<h1>Activating GameMaker: Studio</h1>

<h2><i>GameMaker: Studio</i> requires an internet connection to
activate your licence before you can use it.</h2>

<p>Once you have installed your version of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i>
you will be prompted to enter a License Key the first time you run
the program (unless you have downloaded the <a href=
"Versions.html">free version</a> or you have bought the program
through <b>Steam</b> in which case this step can be skipped as your
licence is tracked by Steam for you).<br>
<br>
The license file will also be emailed to you using the email
address you entered during purchase, and if you've logged into the
YoYo Games store through the "My Account" section, it will also be
tied to that account, allowing you to retrieve it at any time
should that be necessary. If you don't have a YoYo Games login, the
email will also contain details of the new account that has been
automatically setup using the email address you have provided. This
will, again, let you retrieve your <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> License
code from the YoYo Games website. Once you have completed the
licence process, <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> will be ready to use!<br>
<br>
If at anytime in the future you need to re-install <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i>, the latest version, complete with all available
updates, can always be found <a href=
"http://www.yoyogames.com/studio/download" target=
"_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b><i>It is your responsibility to make sure you save the email,
and the Licence Key itself, as you will need it anytime you want to
reinstall GameMaker: Studio.</i></b> <img class="center" src=
"../Images/licensescreen.png"></p>

<h4>Important</h4>

<p>While <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> itself does not require an
internet connection to be used, it will require occasional access
to maintain the license activated. If you cannot connect your
computer to the internet for any long period of time, you can
download the <b>license check file</b> from the YoYo Games website,
and then point the auto update system to it. If you fail to provide
a valid license file, or there is no internet connection when
requested, your copy of <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> will not work
until such time as this is resolved.</p>

<h3>Additional Modules</h3>

<p><i><b>NOTE:</b> These extra modules can only be bought if you
have already upgraded to <a href="Versions.html">GameMaker: Studio
- Professional</a>.<br>
<br>
GameMaker: Studio comes with a number of export options included
when you buy it: Windows and Mac OS X (and Steam Workshop if you
bought the program from Steam), as well as Windows 8 (Native) and
Windows 8 (JS). However additional modules can be purchased easily
from the <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/studio/buy.html" target=
"_blank">YoYo Games Checkout</a>. Once there, all you have to do is
fill in the required information (e-mail address and GameMaker:
Studio base license), then select the target module or modules that
you wish to add. After this has been done, clicking "Proceed" will
take you to the purchase page to confirm the sale. Finally, once
confirmed, you will be given the new license and an email with it
will be sent to the address you have given.<br>
<br>
To use this License, you must now start GameMaker: Studio and go to
"<b>Help</b>", "<b>Update License</b>" and enter your new license
in the appropriate area. Once that is done, you should close
GameMaker: Studio and restart it to enjoy the functionality of the
new modules that you have purchased.<br>
<br></i>
</p>

<h4>Buying Additional Modules From Steam</h4>

<p>If you bought <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> through <b>Steam</b> you
can also purchase these modules easily on-line from the same
service, with no licence being required as Steam keeps track of
your details for you. To access the available modules, you must run
your Steam Client, go to the Library and right click on the
<i>GameMaker: Studio</i> entry. From the right click menu that pops
up you should select the option <b>View Downloadable Content</b>
which will open the application <b>Properties</b> window and there
you can select, buy and install the module of your choice.<br>
