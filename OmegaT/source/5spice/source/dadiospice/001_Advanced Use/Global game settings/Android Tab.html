<h1>The Android Tab</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the Android tab of the Global Games
Settings Window.</h2>

<p>This Android tab is split into two separate <i>sub-tabs</i>
(accessible on the left of the window) to make changing and
updating the information for your game clearer and less
complicated. These tabs are explained in the following
sections.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="Android_General_Tab.png"> The first
thing to do is fill in the details about your game, including its
<b>Display Name</b>, its <b>Package Name</b> and the <b>Version</b>
info. The package name can only be made up of letters from A-Z and
numbers 0-9, with no symbols or other special characters at all,
nor should it have uppercase characters. It should follow the
format <i>“com.domain.myapp”</i>.<br>
<br>
To the right of the page, you can add a splash screen to your APK,
which will be shown while the game loads on the device. This screen
should be a 24bit PNG file, and is recommended to be the same size
as the first room (or view) in your game.<br>
<br>
On this page you can also set the following options for your final
APK file:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Architectures</b> - This is the CPU type that your game will
support. The most common ones are chosen by default (99% of all
devices use these), but you can choose those that you think
appropriate. Bear in mind that each one will add about 1MB to the
final apk size, don't go ticking them all unless this is not a
problem!</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Orientation</b> - Here you can choose to lock the game to a
specific orientation by checking either landscape, portrait,
landscape-flipped or portrait-flipped. Note that if you have
selected Portrait and PortraitFlipped, then this is handled as
<i>sensorPortrait</i>, but not all devices will allow the
PortraitFlipped orientation in this mode.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Misc</b> - This section permits you to add extra support for
certain features:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>you can add <i>iCade Support</i> or <i>Bluetooth</i> gamepads
(see the functions for <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Mouse, Keyboard and Other Controls/GamePad Input/index.html">
GamePad Input</a></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>you can add <i>Haptic Effects</i> which will permit the use of
vibration in your game. Haptics are dependant of you accepting the
<b>Immersion EULA</b> that pops up. If you decline to accept the
agreement, then haptic effects will not be enabled, and if you have
code for them in your game, the game will fail to compile. For more
information on the <i>GameMaker: Studio</i> haptic effects, see the
section <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Mouse, Keyboard and Other Controls/Immersion Haptics/index.html">
Immersion Haptics</a>.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>if your game is being created for the <b>OUYA</b> games
console, then you can specify that the final APK should be packaged
in accordance with the console specifications here.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li>you can set the <b>Install Location</b> for your game. This can
either be set to <i>auto</i>, in which case the game will be
installed to the location chosen by the user on their device, or it
can be set to <i>Prefer External</i> which will always try to
install the game to the external storage of the device.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="Android_Graphics_Tab.png"> The graphics
tab has three sections to it - <b>Options</b>, <b>Icons</b> and
<b>Texture Pages</b>. The first of these controls the display
options for your game, with the first one being the <b>Interpolate
colours Between Pixels</b> flag. This turns on interpolation, which
basically "smooths" pixels, so for crisp pixel graphics, it should
be off, but if you have nice alpha blends and smoothed edge
graphics it is better left on.<br>
<br>
Next, you can set the <b>Screen colour Depth</b> to either
<b>16bit</b> or <b>24bit</b>. This will affect the compatibility
with some older devices if it is set to 24bit, and will also
increase the <i>ashmem</i> that is needed (this is the shared
memory on Android devices).<br>
<br>
The next here is the <b>Device Support</b> for your game. You can
choose to support any device, or only those that have a GPU.
Basically, if your game has any advanced drawing functions like
alpha blending, additive blending, surfaces, etc... you should
limit it to those devices that have a GPU otherwise you run the
risk of getting negative comments and poor rating for your game due
to graphical errors or crashes on older devices.<br>
<br>
Finally there is the option for scaling to the device screen. Here
you can choose to maintain aspect ratio (so a 4:3 room, for
example, will be "letter boxed" on a 16:9) or to scale fully
(stretching the image to fit the full screen).</p>

<blockquote><i><b>WARNING!</b> Switching off the application
surface in your code will disable all the scaling options set in
the Global Game Settings until it has been switched back on again.
See <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Surfaces/The Application Surface.html">The
Application Surface</a> for further details.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>After these options there is the section for setting the size of
the <b>Texture Page</b>. The default (and most compatible) size is
1024x1024, but you can choose from anywhere between 256x256 up to
2048x2048. There is also a button marked <b>View</b> which will
generate the texture pages for this platform and then open a window
so that you can see how they look. This can be very useful if you
wish to see how the texture pages are structured and to prevent
having texture pages larger (or smaller) than necessary.<br>
<br>
On the right of the page you can set the game icons. These are used
in various situations on the Store and in your Game, and should be
creates as 24bit PNG files of the appropriate sizes given.</p>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that the larger the size of
the texture page, the less compatible your game will be.</i>
</blockquote>

<h3>Social</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="Android_Social_Tab.png"> This tab
permits you to enable social functions for your Android game with
either <b>Amazon GameCircle</b> or <b>Google Play</b>. Both markets
permits you to add achievements and leaderboards for your games in
a simple way, allowing worldwide highscores as well as local ones.
Once you have ticked the appropriate checkboxes, you will need to
code the functionality into your game using the <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Social Gaming/Achievements and Leaderboards/index.html">
Achievements and Leaderboards</a> functions.<br>
<br>
If you are using <b>GameCircle</b>, you can also enable
<b>WhisperSync</b> which is an Amazon based cloud storage service
(see the section on <a href=
"../../002_Reference/Cloud Services/index.html">Cloud Services</a>
for more information).<br>
<br>
If you use <b>Google Play</b> you will need to add your <i>App
Id</i> into this tab for the functions to work (this can be found
from your Google Play Developers dashboard).<br>
<br></p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="Android_Permissions_Tab.png"> From this
tab you can change some of the permissions that your game may
request within the <b>Android Manifest</b>. <i>GameMaker:
Studio</i> allocate permissions automatically as required, however
you may find you require a permission for your game that we haven't
assigned in which case tick the requisite permission box on the
tab. The list below outlines those that are available:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</b> - Will permit your game to write
to external storage.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>READ_PHONE_STATE</b> - Allow read only access to the phone
state.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</b> - Permit your game to access
information about networks.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>INTERNET</b> - Permit your game to open network
sockets.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>BLUETOOTH</b> - Will permit your game to connect to paired
Bluetooth devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><b>NOTE:</b> If you are not sure that you need
these, you should probably just leave them un-checked by default
and let GameMaker: Studio deal with the permissions for your
game.</i>
